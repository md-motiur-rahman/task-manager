# Task Manager

## This is a very normal ToDo application with common CRUD functionality.

## For this simple app I used NodeJS for API, MongoDB for database and EJS for rendering/frontend.

### Steps are simple. 
- Download the file
- Run simple command ```npm i```. 
- Before that create your nosql database
- Create your own .env file.
- Connect the server/database. 

#### I used Mongod driver for connection. If you want to use local server then do the modification accordingly.

### And finally run ```npm run dev```

### I am still on learning phase. Please feel free to contribute.
